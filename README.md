## My process

### Built with

- TypeScript
- SCSS/SASS
- CSS Modules
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

I learned a lot about TypeScript and how to create types and interfaces for different elements such as useStates or props. I also learned how to use SASS mixins and variables to reduce the amount of CSS code utilized. I feel there's still room for improving my SASS code and further optimize it.


### Continued development

For my future projects I'll be diving deeper in TypeScript as I really enjoyed the sense of security it provides. I'll be using it alongside Tailwind CSS and Next.js next time.
